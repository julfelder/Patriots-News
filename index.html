        <h2>Power Moves Only</h2>
        <p>The Hoodie is back at it again this offseason with a series of moves that are leaving the rest of the league wetting their shorts. First, lets start with the Chandler Jones trade. The Pro-Bowl DE was one of the best players in the league last year, leading the Patriots with 12.5 sacks. This man is a freak of nature and an unbelieveable football player. Despite these facts, he was owed upwards of $8 million next season. It wouldn't have been possible to keep him, along with Jamie Collins, Hightower and Butler, whose contracts will all be up at the same time. So what did Bellichick do? He goes out and grabs another second round pick to make up for the tragic pillaging of the Patriots first rounder, and gets a 7th overall pick guard Jonathan Cooper. I can't help thinking back to Richard Seymore in '09. I was devistated at the time, but it turned out to be the right move.</p>
        <p>Filling the void, Bill goes out and signs DE Chris Long, another monster with about a third of the contract of Jones for a one year contract. Then he does it again and picks up LB Shea McCellan on a three year $8.9 million contract. You give Bill some cap space to play around with and he goes and secures what should be two all-star additions to an up-and-coming elite defense.</p>
        <p>You also may have heard about Gronk's tweet, covered in my next article. The patriots don't mess around with contracts and hold-outs, and Gronk is no exceptions. So what does Bellichik do? He goes and signs Martellus Bennett on a 4 year, $20 million contract. Not only is this a warning to keep Gronkowski in line, but it opens up a whole new level of offense, bringing back the two TE sets that we saw with Hernandez. <a href="http://nesn.com/2016/03/robert-kraft-believes-rob-gronkowski-is-quite-happy-with-patriots/" target="_blank">Here is Rex Ryan talking about the threat</a> The wheels are always turning in the Patriots Headquarters. #pinkstripes</p>

        <h2>Trouble in Paradise?</h2>
        <p> Gronk is the best tight end in the league, and possibly in history. These are indisputable facts. However, after the Patriots picked up the remaining $6 million on his option, Rob's anual income comes out to $9 million a year, less than Jimmy Graham, Travis Kelce and Julius Thomas.</p>
        <p> In response to this development Gronkowski tweete out "If ya think about it that Option pick up basically equals pay cut the next 4 seasons...I don't work hard for those reasons.Haha" When asked about the tweet, Drew Rosenhaus, Gronk's agent responded <a href="http://www.csnne.com/new-england-patriots/rob-gronkowskis-agent-sidesteps-contract-issue" target="_blank">“Not talking about that, I appreciate you asking but not getting into that,”</a> Robert Kraft said that he believed Gronk was <a href="http://nesn.com/2016/03/robert-kraft-believes-rob-gronkowski-is-quite-happy-with-patriots/" target="_blank">"quite happy"</a> with the patriots.</p>
        <p>Listen. Gronk may look at the numbers and feel like he deserves more, but let's be real here. It's Gronk we're talking about. Gronk doesn't really tend to think things through before he says them, and twitter is notorious for not being filtered. Gronk has a good thing going in New England. Perfect passes from Tom, and daddy Bellichick to blackmail paparazzis with videos of Gronk's wild side. This will blow over and go down as the biggest non-story of the off season.</p>

        <h2>On to 2017</h2>
        <p>Looking forward to next season, there are 10 games on lock for the Pats. I'm not even going to talk about the AFC East, Cleveland, LA ect. Now lets look at the real games. The Steelers are drooling at the thought of coming to Gillette and beating the patriots. They have a hell of alot of talent too. This will be a great game for sure. Seattle also has plenty of talent, even if their record didn't neccesarily reflect it last year. Russel Wilson may be a Herb off the field, but you can count on him to toss a couple long balls and have his recievers come up with them. Patriots should win this one, but it will be a good rematch of Suberbowl XLIX. The Ravens are rivals, and while they don't compare to the talent that is on New England, they somehow seem to always play the patriots close. Can't wait to see Brady throw up 40 against these crybabies. The bengas are a good team, and probably could have faced the Patriots in the AFC championship game last year if Andy Dalton was healthy. I'll be watching to see if they can repeat last season's sucesses. Arizona is a good team, despite being embarrased by the Panthers in the playoffs last year. With the addition of Chandler Jones to their defense, they will be a team to beat in the NFC provided they can find a suitable replacement for Larry Fitzgerald. Lastly, we have Denver. I am not too concerned about the denver offense, as of now to be led by Mark "buttfumble" Sanchez. But their defense led by Superbowl MVP Von Miller still worries me. Hopefully the Pats Offensive line can get their act togeather, as I am confident that if Brady isn't hit 20+ times in the game again it should be a lock.</p>
